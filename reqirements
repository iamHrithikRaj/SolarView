Requirements

-- API that provides data on the solar energy potential of building roofs throughout the city. 
# 15-20% Solar -> Electric
	-- Elevation building 
	-- 
# Watt of Power is produced
	-- Kaggle dataset 
	-- Machine Learning

Question to be answered : solar energy potential of building roofs -- 1 sqm 15-20% ??? energy

-- The API should also provide data on how alternative energy sources could reduce a particular building’s emissions footprint. 
	-- Comparisons
		| -- Then(When using conventional power ) v/s Now (When 				using solar power )
	-- Quantify
		| -- reduced power consumtion or reduced emission footprint
		| -- 

-- simple web interface (Interactive Form) for a building owner to search for their property to view data on the solar potential of their roof and the impact on the emissions associated with their building’s energy use.


-- This project will require intermediate experience with data analysis packages, GIS(GeoPandas), and building web service APIs with either Python.
