### Solar View primarily aims to encourage the private adoption of solar energy by providing a set of tools to facilitate the purchase and installation of solar panels. Using data provided by the user, the Solar View website calculates how much money a user can expect to save yearly by making use of solar power. In addition, the Solar View website also provides a list of local solar power retailers capable of installing solar panels in that area.

### The project is planned eventually to expand nationally or even globally, depending upon the project's success in its launch areas.

### This project was heavily inspired by Project Sunroof.
